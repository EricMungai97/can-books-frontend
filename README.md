## Project Name

**Author**: Domaine Scully and Eric Mungai Kinuthia

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) This assignment overview entails peer partnership and development. It illustrates how cohorts work together to accomplish  a common goal.

## Getting Started

What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? Follow the directions thoroghly and implement the lessons learned in lecture to get a successful outcome.

## Architecture

Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. The languages used were MERN and Javascript.

## Change Log

Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

11-02-2022 7:08pm - Application now has been and is fully-functional regarding express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

4. Communication
**How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?**
***Domaine***
By ensuring we get the front end working as it should with all bugs and errors taken care of.
***Eric***
Ensuring we get our back end running smoothly. Having it communicate with the mongo database and our front end.
Communicating with my partner to make sure we are on the right track.
**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**
Domaine
Being able to write executable code for the backend using express js .
Eric
Being able to express my thoughts.
**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**
Letting each other know where we are at in regards to the project.
Having a to do list so we can tackle each aspect of the assignment.
Making sure to complete every daily to do list with everything working as it should.

### Conflict-Resolution

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**
Let the other person know and talk about why they are not helping.
This is so we try and get back to the same page, by establishing why the issue is happening.
**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**
We’ll remind each other of our divided roles and why it is we chose to assign them the way we did. We will also talk about why that person feels the need to take over and see if we can eliminate or fix whatever is making them feel that way.
**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
By communicating with each other. Things like asking for help when stuck or not understanding how something works. Asking for help when you feel overwhelmed and so on.
